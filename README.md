Terms and conditions
--------------------
 * This document identifies and declares what Ruby courses are taking at Masters Academy in 2019 - 2020.
 * This course is hosted by Masters Academy, on a voluntary basis with a donation to the account of the school for children with visual impairments.
 * The purpose of the courses is to assist stakeholders in learning the Ruby programming language and the RubyOnRails framework and related technologies.
 * The courses are a voluntary educational initiative that aims to provide useful information in a way that is convenient for mentors and students, with a focus on self-motivation, two-way curiosity, bilateral interest and experience sharing.
 * Courses do not provide for passing tests, exams and awarding diplomas; it does not mean of obtaining a certificate of any kind. Our goal is not to perform formal procedures for student, but to achieve a certain level of professionalism. Students who are particularly distinguished can receive letters of recommendation from mentors, signed by the mentor.
 * In the courses, mentor submits subjective knowledges at their own discretion, using common sense and experience.
 * The final goal of the courses is to share an experience and knowledges as much as possible to the students for their professional growth and development. The project, developed by student, individually or in a group, will allow to anyone to look at the student's mastery of the Ruby programming language and related tools.
 * Courses can be visited by all interested, adequate and discerning people with minimal programming skills, who made a donation to the account of the school for children with visual impairments. Students are expected to be self-motivated, ready to ask questions and determine on their own what kind of assistance or help mentors can provide.
 * We are not a kindergarten or a school, it's not interesting for mentors to hear excuses for why a student did not do their homework, and so the purpose of the student is to interest the mentor in the sharing of experience, we are all adults).
 * Classes are held according to schedule one day a week, on changes in the schedule we will notify ASAP, but any rescheduling is possible due to objective reasons.
 * Student must realize at the beginning, that everything he or she receives from the courses is 99% dependent on him / her.
